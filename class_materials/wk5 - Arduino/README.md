# Week 5: Arduino

Taught by Matt Ganucheau

### Course Description
Arduino is an open-source electronics prototyping platform intended for artists designers, hobbyists and anyone interested in creating interactive objects or environments.  This week will introduce students to the Arduino and its programing environment.  Students will also learn how to use wide variety of sensors and actuators.  Each student leave with the tools needed to begin building their own interactive projects at home. No prior experience with electronicsis required.
