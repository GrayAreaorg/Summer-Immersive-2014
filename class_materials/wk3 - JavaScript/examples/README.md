# Examples
These are some standalone examples of "sketches" that you can build on.
They're also available in JSFiddle to fork as you see fit:

1. An [animated sine wave](sine-wave.html) (animation, math, drawing)
1. A [canvas-based drawing tool](canvas-draw.html) (events, drawing lines)
1. An object-oriented simulation (classes, drawing)
1. An [SVG-based drawing tool](d3-draw.html) (D3, events, data binding)
1. A [spiral of animating shapes](spiral-shapes.html) (animation, iteration, transforms)
1. A [mesh of points with force layout](mesh.html) (particle systems)
1. An artistic rendering of dynamic text (loading data, data binding)
<!-- 1. A [laser beam that bounces off walls](laser.html) (math, animation) -->
