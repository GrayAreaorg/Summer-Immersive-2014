# Week 2: Processing

Taught by Matt Ganucheau

### Course Description
"Processing is an open source programming language and environment for people who want to program images, animation, and interactions. It is used by students, artists, designers, researchers, and hobbyists for learning, prototyping, and production. It is created to teach fundamentals of computer programming within a visual context and to serve as a software sketchbook and professional production tool." - http://www.openprocessing.org/

This class will give an overview of programing fundamentals (variables, conditionals, iteration, functions, and objects) as well as how to apply them creatively. A variety of techniques such as image processing, 3D animation, computer vision, and live data gathering will be covered. This course is designed for computer programming novices although experienced coders are welcome.
