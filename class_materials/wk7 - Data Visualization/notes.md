### What Is Data?
> "information which has been abstracted in some schematic form, including attributes or variables for the units of information" - [Michael Friendly](http://www.datavis.ca/personal/)

* Data is an abstraction.
* There is no such thing as "raw data". All data is subject to bias or flawed collection methods.
* Data is often expressed in *aggregate*, rather than as individual entries.
  * Aggregation methods
  * When to aggregate: "big data" vs. "little data"

### What Is Visualization?

> "the creation and study of the visual representation of data" - [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_visualization)

* Visualization is also an abstraction, but I find it helpful to think of it as an **expression of occurrence**.
* "Visualization" describes both a process and a result.
* *Infographics* vs. *data visualization*: manual design vs. automation

* Ben Fry describes the process of visualizing in his book, [Visualizing Data]():
  1. **Acquire**: "Obtain the data, whether from a file on a disk or a source over a network."
  1. **Parse**: "Provide some structure for the data's meaning, and order it into categories."
  1. **Filter**: "Remove all but the data of interest."
  1. **Mine**: "Apply methods from statistics or data mining as a way to discern patterns or place the data in mathematical context."
  1. **Represent**: "Choose a basic visual model, such as a bar graph, list, or tree."
  1. **Refine**: "Improve the basic representation to make it clearer and more visually engaging."
  1. **Interact**: "Add methods for manipulating the data or controlling what features are visible."
