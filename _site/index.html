<p>Gray Area&#39;s Summer Immersive is a ten week program devoted to learning the art
of creative coding held on June 16th – August 23rd. Our mission is to apply
digital art and technology to create positive social impact. This Immersive is
part of Gray Area’s commitment to teach digital tools to support artists and
technologists and inspire the community by promoting meaningful new work. To
keep creative code education as accessible as possible we charge a course fee
that covers our nonprofit costs of paying our artist-instructors a living wage
for the 120 hours of classroom instruction, and providing classroom and related
support services The enrollment fee is $3,000, which breaks down to $25 per
hour of classroom instruction.</p>
