I am currently working with everything from interactive media and creative coding to conceptual sculpture and performance. Displacement of context is the setting for the storyline in my works. In front of the backdrop and on a floor of memory, objects become characters that play out something created all on their own. They sing songs in which the words all rhyme but fall out of rhythm. I am interested in telling stories through objects and design. I find my theater of inspiration in department stores. All the clorox bottles act out a drama with the sponges as do the fruits and the pasteurized juice concentrate in the nearby refrigerated section. Part of my life has always been influenced by commercialization and design. I find that to design is human, but to error is nature. In this context I tell stories about nature and design.
