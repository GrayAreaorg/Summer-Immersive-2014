# 2014 Summer Immersive
####June 16th – August 23rd

Gray Area's Summer Immersive is a ten week program
devoted to learning the art of creative coding held on June 16th – August 23rd. Our mission is to apply digital art and technology to create positive social impact. This Immersive is part of Gray Area’s commitment to teach digital tools to support artists and technologists and inspire the community by promoting meaningful new work. To keep creative code education as accessible as possible we charge a course fee that covers our nonprofit costs of paying our artist-instructors a living wage for the 120 hours of classroom instruction, and providing classroom and related support services The enrollment fee is $3,000, which breaks down to $25 per hour of classroom instruction.
